## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+
* Xcode 8.0+

## Usage

### Code

Create one of the Wave View (Wave, SimpleWave of Bars) and add it as a subview anywhere, customize it changing the colors and update it setting its `value` property based on the audio input.

### Storyboard

Drag a view into your scene and set its Class to be `WaveView` and the Module to `OCWaveView`. Then you can inspect the colors for each wave and the initial value.

Create an outlet and change its `value` property according to the audio input to update the waves.
